# Shield Insurance - Performance Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
Shield Insurance is a fictional Insurance Company offering a broad portfolio of insurance plans across India. The company faced challenges in analyzing data scattered across different cities, sales channels, and customer segments. 

This project involves the creation of a comprehensive **Power BI Dashboard** to unify this data, providing actionable insights into revenue trends, customer demographics, and sales mode performance to support strategic decision-making.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Shield Insurance struggled with:
* **Data Silos:** Data was scattered across systems, making it difficult to monitor growth.
* **Limited Visibility:** Lack of insights into demographic metrics and sales channel performance.
* **Decision Latency:** Inability to make fast, data-driven decisions due to low BI usage.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Power BI:** For data modeling, DAX calculations, and visualization.
* **Excel:** For initial data cleaning and understanding the raw dataset.
* **Power Query:** For data transformation and ETL processes.

## 🗝️ Key Metrics (Nov 2022 - Apr 2023)
* **Total Revenue:** ₹989.3 Million
* **Total Customers:** 26,841
* **Daily Revenue Growth:** ₹5.47 Million
* **Dominant Market:** Delhi NCR & Mumbai account for ~65% of total premiums.

## 💡 Key Insights
### 1. Seasonality Trends
* **March Surge:** There was a massive spike in revenue (+85%) and customer acquisition (+82.3%) in March, likely driven by fiscal year-end tax-saving purchases.
* **April Slump:** Immediately following March, revenue corrected sharply by -42%, indicating a heavy reliance on seasonal cycles.

### 2. Customer Demographics
* **The "Cash Cow" (Age 31-40):** This group contributes the highest revenue and customer volume with a moderate settlement risk (53.5%).
* **High Risk Segment (65+):** While premiums are high (avg ₹96k), the settlement rate is alarming at 74.3%, squeezing profit margins.
* **Young Demographics (18-24):** Lowest revenue contribution but very low risk (37.5% settlement rate).

### 3. Sales Channels
* **Offline Dominance:** Offline Agents are the primary revenue driver, contributing **55.7%** (₹550M) of total revenue.
* **Digital Lag:** Online Apps and Websites combined only contribute ~29% of revenue, highlighting a massive opportunity for digital transformation.

## 🚀 Strategic Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to Shield Insurance:
1.  **Flatten Seasonality:** Launch mid-year "Health Check-up" campaigns or lower-premium products in Q2/Q3 to reduce dependence on the March peak.
2.  **Digital Push for "Cash Cows":** Target the 31-40 age group with exclusive "Online-Only" discounts to shift them from expensive Agent-channels to the App/Website, reducing CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost).
3.  **Audit Senior Policies:** Conduct a strict profitability audit on the 65+ age group. If premiums do not cover the 74% claim ratio, underwriting norms must be tightened.
4.  **Regional Focus:** Double down on marketing in Delhi NCR and Mumbai, as these are high-value markets responding well to current products.
